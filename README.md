## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

You can use this code for your own website with attribution.

Maintaining an open-source website is important to me, but as you may be aware, plagiarism is unethical. It is always dispiriting when I discover that my website has been replicated without any acknowledgment. I invested a significant amount of time and energy into constructing and designing this current version of my website, and I take pride in it. Therefore, my only request to all of you is to refrain from taking credit for my hard work.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
